Hi there! I am Deepto Debnath.

I develop apps for fun, yet apps that should be a joy to use. I am just getting started, so if you're a developer and think I am making mistakes, do correct me. You can:
* Email me at [dd1929@protonmail.com](mailto:dd1929@protonmail.com).
* File an issue in the corresponding repositories.
